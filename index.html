            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Chinenye Chigere, a student of Alt School Africa with student ID ID-ALT/SOE/023/2374. <br> I am a graduate of Food Science and Technology from Ebonyi State University, a mother to 5 beautiful kids and guardian to one ward. </p><br>
            <p>I joined the School of Engineering at Alt School Africa to learn about programming, change my career and be financially independent.</p><br>
            <p>I hope to be one of the best programmers and help bring cutting-edge solutions to the coding community and society. I will really love to empower women who are capable but unable to access opportunities in the tech field.</p>
